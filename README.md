Welcome to the Smart Personal Care Store, a modern JavaFX-based desktop application that brings a full-fledged online store experience right to your desktop! This project demonstrates a complete shopping workflow — from browsing beautifully designed product cards, managing your cart, and checking out, to generating invoices in PDF format. With a responsive and intuitive UI, realistic stock management, and role-based login for admin and customers, it’s more than just a demo — it’s a showcase of JavaFX, MVC architecture, and object-oriented design principles in action. Perfect for learning and experimenting with GUI programming, data handling, and application navigation in Java.
